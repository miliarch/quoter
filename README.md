# Quoter
A python module that pulls quotes from [Wikiquote](https://www.wikiquote.org/)

## Goals and progress
**Status**: In Development

Quoter is very much a work in progress as of February 2019. My efforts are currently centered around probing the Wikiquote API to get a better idea of what patterns appear and what knobs can be tweaked. End goal is to implement some sane filter set to get a solid random quote most of the time, optimally providing the user ability to customize the filter set.
